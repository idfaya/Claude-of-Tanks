# Multiplayer architecture

Status: implemented and playable. LAN, private room codes, and ranked matches
enter the renderer-free authoritative simulation. Solo bots deliberately keep
the original presentation-integrated local simulation: this avoids snapshot,
prediction, serialization, and duplicate presentation work in the latency-free
mode while preserving the game's established high-refresh performance.

## Product contract

| Mode | Authority | Transport | Ranking |
|---|---|---|---|
| Solo vs bots | local browser | direct in-page simulation | local battle record |
| LAN | one trusted browser host | direct WebRTC | unranked |
| Private code | one trusted browser host | WebRTC, with configured TURN fallback | unranked |
| Ranked | dedicated Node service | authenticated WebSocket | server-owned Elo |

`src/ui/playMenu.ts` owns the strict browser entry boundary for these modes:
persisted identity and invite input are normalized before signaling, ICE and
lobby state remain typed through create/join and ready-up, and the acquisition
session is relinquished only when the active room coordinator accepts it.

Network modes change who hosts and how packets travel while sharing one combat
authority. Player/entity identity is independent from vehicle identity, so two
commanders may field the same tank without aliasing state. Solo remains a
separate optimized composition of the same core movement, armor, ballistics,
damage, spotting, and AI modules.

The deployment choice and battle rule are independent. Private and LAN rooms
can run Standard Battle, Capture the Flag, Zone Control, Turbo Ball, or Endless
Horde. The host owns `gameMode` in canonical lobby state; changing it clears
ready flags, and every round hands that value to the same renderer-free
authority used by solo. Horde seats every human on Alpha and fills only the
Bravo wave pool with authority-owned bots. Ranked remains Standard Battle until
its dedicated service explicitly negotiates another ruleset.

## Runtime boundaries

- `src/sim/authoritativeMatch.ts` is the strict renderer-free battle authority
  shared by browser-hosted and dedicated matches.
- `src/net/matchRuntime.ts` owns fixed ticks, input ordering, readiness,
  viewer-specific snapshots, catch-up limits, and connection state.
- `src/net/browserBattleBridge.ts` turns authority snapshots and events into
  first-party Three.js visuals without resolving gameplay locally.
- `src/net/networkFramePump.ts` owns browser host/client frame order, input
  cadence, reliable-event draining, snapshot waits, and diagnostics.
- `src/net/networkRoomCoordinator.ts` owns lobby-to-room presentation,
  selection locks, chat buffering, ready/start commands, and rematch claims.
  It admits only complete canonical lobby packets to the retained-room menu;
  a partial match-room packet cannot mutate that UI contract.
- `src/net/networkBattlePresentationRuntime.ts` owns the complete covered
  cold-client transition for private/LAN and dedicated adapters. Module, world,
  and transport acquisition overlap; a bridge is published only after exact
  roster preparation and a viewer-bearing authoritative snapshot; warmup and
  peer readiness finish before atomic activation and loader reveal.
- `src/net/networkBattlePresentationAccess.ts` demand-loads that deep owner on
  network-mode or joined-lobby intent and retries a transient chunk failure.
- `src/net/connectionRecovery.ts` owns the single reconnect/failure
  presentation edge while the session rebuilds transport underneath it.
- `src/net/privateRoomConnectionRuntime.ts` owns private/LAN room acquisition,
  parallel signaling connection and ICE discovery, pre-announcement cold-guest
  readiness, stable-host reload detection, selection replay, state observation,
  cancellation generations, and the exact handoff/teardown order. The play
  menu renders and commands the resulting connection but cannot construct a
  second transport lifecycle. Its lazy play-surface loader imports the menu's
  public types rather than maintaining a permissive parallel interface.
- `src/net/localSession.ts` provides loopback authority for protocol tests and
  tooling; normal solo play does not load it.
- `src/net/privateRoomSession.ts` and `privateMatchHandoff.ts` own WebRTC lobby
  composition, seeded bot fill, and channel handoff.
- `server/dedicatedMatchServer.ts` and `dedicatedMatchRegistry.ts` own ranked
  WebSocket authority and reconnectable match lifetimes.

All twenty maps use the same authored collision, terrain, foliage concealment,
destructible indices, and loadout rules in solo, browser-hosted, and dedicated play.
Dedicated Node matches inflate collision from the generated
`server/world-collision-manifests.json`; browser hosts use the live `World`
collision facade.

The Unity 2022.3 port follows the same ownership split. `GameFlowController`
hands a canonical lobby plan to `NetworkBattleController`;
`RoomMatchBattleFactory` builds the same map collision, loadout, and game-mode
simulation used by the Unity dedicated server. Only the host advances that
simulation. `NetworkBattlePresenter` consumes filtered snapshots for tank,
shell, destructible, objective, HUD, minimap, audio, and FX presentation.
The v2 Unity lobby plan preserves team size; `RoomMatchBattleFactory`
deterministically fills open team slots with authority-owned bots and creates
the Bravo wave pool for Endless Horde.
Returning from battle transfers the existing RTC channels back to
`PrivateRoomCoordinator`, so a rematch creates a fresh authority without
rejoining signaling.

Unity snapshot codec v4 adds viewer-spotted state plus compact module-condition
and crew-alive masks for authoritative HUD/audio presentation. v3 added the
complete mode state (scores, flags, zones, ball, and Horde wave) and kill
counts. The decoder retains v1-v3 compatibility; client presentation never
derives those facts locally.

## Protocol and authority

Protocol v4 uses validated envelopes with a finite message vocabulary,
sequence/acknowledgement fields, and simulation ticks. Clients submit controls
only: throttle, steering, brake, bounded aim yaw/pitch/distance, shell choice,
fire, and explicit consumable action bits. Distance preserves the finite
center-screen point and close-range parallax used by solo gunnery; it is not a
trusted hit position. Clients cannot submit a trusted position, hit, damage,
spotting result, reload completion, or match clock.

Authority runs at 60 Hz and publishes viewer-specific state at 20 Hz. Hidden
enemy coordinates are removed before serialization. Shells and combat events
have their own reveal rules. Inputs that are stale, implausibly far ahead,
malformed, or sent before the handshake are rejected without poisoning the
connection sequence.

## Delivery model

LAN/private WebRTC uses two data channels:

- `cot-match-v1`: ordered and reliable for handshake, lobby, room chat,
  combat events, ping, errors, and leave control.
- `cot-state-v1`: unordered with zero retransmits for replaceable snapshots
  and live input.

Ranked WebSocket remains ordered, but coalesces pending snapshot or input state
so stale frames cannot consume the reliable control budget. Input and reliable
control have independent sequence spaces, preventing reordered steering from
starving room commands. Fire, consumable, and manual-magazine-reload edges
repeat until a snapshot acknowledges receipt; authority deduplicates action
rising edges before the simulation sees them. All transports enforce payload and buffered-byte limits
and fail visibly on sustained backpressure.

Snapshots use a compact binary codec, explicit snapshot acknowledgements,
per-peer deltas, and periodic keyframes. A missing delta baseline waits for a
recovering keyframe rather than inventing state.

Reload presentation is authoritative. Each entity row carries remaining and
total reload time, reload phase, ready-rack rounds, and magazine capacity. The
browser bridge never reconstructs magazine state from muzzle events, so packet
loss cannot create a locally fireable round that the authority does not own.

One-shot combat/destruction events travel independently over reliable control
instead of living only inside replaceable snapshots. The browser bridge drains
critical state immediately and budgets expensive cosmetic presentation across
frames. Persistent facts are reconstructible after packet loss or reconnect:
the verdict is mirrored in snapshot metadata and destructible state carries a
revision plus destroyed identifiers in keyframes.

Per-vehicle reactive-armor depletion follows the same rule. Entity keyframes
carry a sorted optional `eraSpent` list. A live reliable `shell:hit` event owns
the one-shot blast/audio timing, while the snapshot list owns durable visual
truth: a late joiner or recovering client removes the exact spent cassettes,
and an empty set in a new round restores them. The compact RTC row leaves the
column sparse for the common no-activation case, and delta equality compares
the identifiers by content rather than array identity.

The browser host's own peer still crosses the exact protocol/runtime boundary,
but its in-process transport delivers synchronously and without cloning. The
presentation bridge and snapshot sampler reuse their frame/entity arrays and
objects, so a 120 Hz render loop does not manufacture a new scene-state object
graph every frame. Network diagnostics also stay dormant unless F3 is open.
During lobby-to-match handoff, a slow host buffers an already-loaded client's
ordered match handshake until authority owns the WebRTC channel; renderer load
order therefore cannot strand either peer at the readiness barrier.

## Client smoothness

Remote tanks use Hermite position interpolation, shortest-path angle blending,
an adaptive 100–220 ms jitter buffer, and at most 250 ms of bounded
extrapolation. The local tank predicts the exact shared 60 Hz movement code,
terrain contact, map bounds, and nearby static collision, then replays
unacknowledged inputs after each authority snapshot. Presentation correction is
grouped by physical role: horizontal hull motion uses an 110 ms envelope,
support height and hull attitude use 160 ms, and live turret/gun aim uses 75 ms.
Recent terrain or dynamic contact extends hull envelopes to 180/240 ms for
300 ms. Errors above 7 m still snap immediately. Death applies its combat state
immediately but settles the displayed wreck onto the final authority pose
through the same bounded correction path, preventing a last-frame hull pop.

RTT samples update a target server-clock offset rather than moving the active
presentation timeline immediately. The client slews toward that target at a
bounded 50 ms per second and caps the correction window after a suspended tab.
Network delay can therefore stretch or compress presentation imperceptibly,
but a late ping response cannot advance a fast tank by a visible fraction of a
meter in one rendered frame.

Both presentation paths suppress quantization chatter only when a tank is
actually at rest. Remote snapshot samples retain a stable hull pose across
sub-contact-patch position and attitude changes; local reconciliation holds the
equivalent correction while neither acknowledged nor pending input requests
motion. Turret yaw and gun pitch always remain independent and live. Any real
drive input, meaningful authority velocity, larger displacement, destruction,
or hard snap releases the resting hold immediately, so stabilization cannot
add steering latency or hide legitimate slope motion.

Press `F3` to view live RTT, jitter, estimated snapshot loss, interpolation
delay, extrapolation, input acknowledgement lag/edge redundancy, transport
coalescing, and reconciliation error. Deterministic browser impairment is
available for QA:

```text
?netSim=1&netLatency=120&netJitter=40&netLoss=10&netdiag=1
```

The latency value is one-way. Reliable control remains ordered; only
replaceable state is eligible for snapshot loss unless `netInputLoss` is set.

These are the useful ideas adopted from CarverJS: separate control/state
delivery, local prediction and reconciliation, an adaptive jitter buffer,
and observable impairment testing. CarverJS itself is not a dependency; the
game keeps its own deterministic tank simulation and authority contracts.

## Lobbies, spectators, bots, and ranking

`src/net/lobby.ts` is the only owner of room capacity, team switching,
spectators, readiness, vehicle/loadout selection, team size, map choice,
locking, host permissions, and start policy. Empty 1v1/2v2/3v3/5v5/7v7 slots are
filled deterministically by authority-owned bots. Bots use seeded diverse
openings, traversability planning on every map, local obstacle recovery, and
the same spotting limits as human players.

`src/net/lobbyRuntime.ts` is the strict transport owner around that policy. It
validates serialized room state before client admission, rejects stale sequence
numbers, bounds the temporary match-handoff inbox, and transfers each live
channel exactly once without a packet-ownership gap.

The canonical room authority also owns display-name uniqueness. Automatic
callsigns are stable per browser identity, while case-insensitive collisions
are deterministically suffixed in both private lobbies and ranked rosters.
Private and LAN hosts can copy a same-deployment invite URL. Opening its
validated `room` query automatically enters the corresponding lobby and joins
the room after the normal loading gate; manual six-character codes remain a
fallback. New links also carry a normalized `host` callsign so the loading
screen and lobby can say “Join Name’s Game.” That URL field is never trusted as
identity: both in-memory and distributed signaling return the canonical host
name in their create/join responses, and the client replaces the hint.

Rooms persist across rounds. Protocol-v5 `ROOM_COMMAND` and `ROOM_STATE`
messages carry round, last result, full human roster, selections, and readiness
on the reliable channel. When authority publishes a result, the room returns
from `playing` to `waiting`, keeps connected peers and the WebRTC channels,
increments its next round at start, and clears every ready flag. The next match
replaces the simulation runtime while preserving transport and room identity.
The typed browser room coordinator subscribes once, releases state and chat
subscriptions together, and admits only one presentation handoff for each new
round number. It never mutates the authoritative lobby locally. A waiting-state
revision that arrives on the final combat edge updates room truth and the garage
reminder immediately, but defers rebuilding the hidden lobby DOM until results,
garage, or an explicit room-open action can actually display it.

A browser reload during `playing` is also a battle-entry intent. Durable
signaling reclaims the stable player seat with a fresh page-session/RTC
generation; the playing-room receipt reconstructs the same map and visual
roster, and the covered loader remains mounted until a viewer-bearing authority
snapshot arrives. If the new channel has already received match authority's
WELCOME, the client preserves that protocol epoch instead of issuing a second
HELLO. The ordinary lobby-to-match path is still unwelcomed and performs its
explicit phase handshake, so the two races cannot impersonate one another.

The browser host does not synchronously fan a completed-round `ROOM_STATE` to
all fourteen transports inside the final authority tick. It sends a small
reliable batch, yields, and continues in bounded batches. Any newer room
revision cancels the unsent older fanout, so a fast ready/rematch command can
never be overwritten by stale waiting state. This keeps room policy identical
while preventing result UI work from becoming a host render hitch.

Battle chat uses dedicated `ROOM_CHAT_COMMAND` and `ROOM_CHAT` control
messages instead of bloating snapshots or room-state broadcasts. Authority
derives the sender name and team from the authenticated room peer, normalizes
plain text, caps messages at 240 characters, throttles each sender, and fans
the accepted message out to every room participant. Clients retain only the
latest 48 messages; the battle UI disables driving and firing while its input
owns focus.

Closing the result report returns to the garage without leaving the room. A
compact room reminder remains under Battle and exposes ready/unready state.
Ready players cannot change vehicle, equipment, or team until they unready;
the strict TypeScript after-action report and lobby both show live play-again
readiness from narrowed room-state events. Only an explicit Leave command
disconnects the peer.

Ranked uses service-scoped anonymous bearer identities, widening Elo search
bands, server team balancing, one-time match tickets, persistent idempotent
settlement, rank names, profiles, and a leaderboard. Fake credits and XP are
absent because every vehicle is available and there is no tech tree. The
garage stores only an honest local battle record; competitive rating remains
server-owned.

The Unity garage exposes the same ranked path through `RankedPanel` and
`RankedCoordinator`. Identity tokens are persisted per service origin, queue
polling is cancellable, and the matched response carries the complete
authoritative `RoomMatchPlan`: round, seed, map, mode, team size, entity ids,
vehicle ids, equipment, camouflage, teams, and ratings. The client consumes
the one-time ticket over `/match`, then hands an authenticated
`DedicatedNetworkClientRuntime` to `NetworkBattleController`. It never creates
or advances match authority locally. Snapshot rendering, local prediction,
HUD, audio, FX, structures, and vegetation use the same
`NetworkBattlePresenter` as private rooms.

`DedicatedNetworkClientRuntime` retains the rotating session token after the
ticket admission. A dropped WebSocket starts bounded reconnect attempts,
reuses the same player/entity identity, keeps snapshot and prediction history,
and replaces only the transport-facing `NetworkClientPump`. The HUD reports
`RECONNECTING` while the authority connection is unavailable. Returning from
the battle polls the original queue ticket until the service publishes the
server-owned result and updated rating.

Spectators receive both teams through an explicitly marked observer peer and
cannot submit vehicle controls. Ranked authority never migrates to a player.
Private/LAN rooms close cleanly if their browser host leaves; host
migration is intentionally not claimed.

Client presentation and input upload use separate clocks. Rendering remains
display-rate, while replaceable held controls are uploaded at the authority's
60 Hz cadence. Fire, consumables, shell selection, braking, and meaningful
analog changes bypass that interval immediately. This prevents 120–240 Hz
displays from multiplying RTC/browser work or inflating sequence backlog while
preserving responsive controls and the existing local prediction path.

Fresh WebRTC handshakes are replay-safe. The typed peer owner retransmits the
same pending offer or answer before attempting a new ICE generation, ignores
duplicate SDP, and reserves ICE restart for a later bounded attempt or an
explicit disconnected/failed connection state. This prevents a slow first
load from racing two offer generations while retaining automatic recovery
from genuine route changes.

Lobby acquisition is generation-guarded too. A host creates its undiscoverable
room in parallel with ICE discovery. A guest connects signaling in parallel
with ICE discovery but sends `room_join` only after the ICE/TURN generation is
ready; announcing it earlier lets a fast host send the offer and candidates
while a cold guest still has no peer-session listener. A mode change, modal
dismissal, or room close invalidates the attempt immediately. A late response
is closed rather than republishing a stale lobby above the Garage. After the
peer runtime opens, the guest replays vehicle, equipment, and camouflage as
ordered reliable commands before the menu permits readiness. Once the battle
room coordinator adopts the transport, the menu forgets its acquisition
generation without closing the handed-off session.

The room-ready promise also survives a bounded replacement of the opening RTC
generation. A guest that times out before its match client exists rotates its
signaling epoch, rejects stale SDP/ICE, and resolves the original lobby entry
through the first replacement transport that opens. Later reconnects retain
the existing match client and its presentation identity.

The two WebRTC data lanes are also recovery signals in their own right. Some
browsers leave the aggregate `RTCPeerConnection.connectionState` at
`connected` after one data channel has closed; a channel cannot reopen in that
generation. Once the protocol has completed `WELCOME`, either lane closing
therefore rotates the signaling epoch and replaces the peer connection while
retaining the existing match client, room seat, and presentation owner.

Non-host refresh after a round is supported. Signaling preserves the stable
browser player id, the joined client keeps the canonical invite URL, and the
host keeps rendezvous listening after lobby-to-match handoff. When the page
returns during the room's waiting phase, a new WebRTC channel is attached to
the existing room controller and current `ROOM_STATE` is replayed. Explicit
Leave removes the URL. Refreshing the browser host is different: it destroys
the browser-owned authority, so host migration is intentionally not claimed.

Browser multiplayer certification creates a distinct pristine browser context
for every participant. Cache, storage, workers, credentials, and player
identity are never shared between the host and guests. The persistent-room
gate additionally drops signaling during live play, resumes the same durable
room, destroys and reconstructs the remote guest document during active play,
reclaims the same authority entity through a fresh RTC page session, completes
the round, readies both players, starts round two over the replacement channel,
and verifies clean departure.

Battle presentation acquires the network modules, exact world, and transport
in parallel. Remote clients and dedicated sessions may complete signaling
while the world is still constructing. A private browser host is the deliberate
exception: its authority owns the rendered world's exact collision adapter, so
connection setup waits for that owner. The parallel barrier publishes a
successfully opened match immediately, ensuring a later world/module failure
closes the transport through the normal cleanup path. Cached rematches use the
same barrier and may return an existing match owner synchronously.

The battle-entry render cover is deliberately narrower than a game pause. It
skips expensive or incomplete scene frames while the opaque briefing is
visible, but the browser network pump continues every frame so first-time
guests can finish `WELCOME`, `READY`, and initial-snapshot exchange. When the
multiplayer composition itself is cold, a boot-safe intent owner presents the
real map and team briefing synchronously before the import starts. The normal
launcher then assumes the same surface, and a failed import unwinds both the
cover and veil without requiring a page refresh.

Before the ready barrier opens, network presentation switches to the exact
battlefield light set and warms the fielded roster rather than a generic
vehicle. The hidden pass submits pursuit dust/exhaust and every impact family,
attaches distance-managed cosmetic groups, patches ordinary wreck materials,
uploads their shared maps, and draws one real isolated fallback probe only when
the exact roster contains non-patchable source geometry. It never builds and
draws a second destroyed copy of the whole roster. Every pose, material, detail
attachment, and visibility flag is restored before the loading veil exits.

Snapshot destruction is ordered as an atomic visual transition: clear the
vehicle's impact decals first, then swap the vehicle materials and wreck state.
The reliable `tank:destroyed` presentation event may repeat the idempotent
cleanup for FX, but correctness cannot wait for that later lane. This prevents
normal-less decals from being mistaken for tank surfaces and compiled into
live `cot:burnt` physical/depth permutations.

`src/net/networkBattleBarrier.ts` owns the two authoritative entry predicates
and the READY retry lease. A slow pristine guest keeps repeating the idempotent
READY edge until countdown or play acknowledges it, but only while its exact
match remains current and open. Success, failure, disposal, or a retained-room
rematch cancels the lease, so no previous round can signal into the next.

The full rendered capacity gate is `npm run test:net:seven:full`. It runs two
independent natural 7v7 battles—one with the browser host rendered and one with
an impaired remote client rendered. All 28 participants across those runs use
pristine browser profiles, retarget living opponents from authority state, and
continue through a real authoritative result. Synthetic commanders pursue and
change ammunition after a 25-second stalemate. The certification authority uses
the simulation's existing 60-second battle-limit option so physically blocking
wrecks resolve through the real `time_limit` path instead of making CI wait for
the production 900-second safety cap. Production room limits are unchanged. The
gate requires every session to receive the result, retain the room in its
waiting phase, and clear readiness; it also enforces transport, prediction,
frame-pacing, shadow, and presentation budgets throughout the match.
On 2026-08-30 the gate passed both rendered roles with 28 pristine browser
profiles. The host-rendered match produced 56 shots from all 14 commanders,
16.7 ms p95 / 30.7 ms maximum frame gaps, and zero hard prediction snaps. The
remote-client-rendered match produced 55 shots from all 14 commanders,
16.6 ms p95 / 18.7 ms maximum gaps, and zero hard snaps. Both results completed
naturally and returned every session to the retained waiting room.
The artifact records exact frame rows around any 40 ms gap and renderer
programs created after the combat baseline, so first-use shader and texture
hitches are attributable rather than hidden by aggregate FPS.

## Deployment and trust

- Production signaling and match services require TLS and explicit origin
  allowlists.
- A public matchmaking mode must force TURN relay so strangers do not learn
  one another's IP addresses. Private code rooms currently negotiate direct
  ICE paths; LAN always remains direct.
- TURN credentials and persistent Elo storage paths are deployment secrets.
- A public competitive deployment should bind the existing service identity
  seam to real account/auth infrastructure. Client-owned solo results must
  never be accepted as ranked outcomes.

The signaling server only relays room membership, SDP, and ICE. Gameplay never
travels through it. Production room membership lives in Redis and signaling
notifications use Redis pub/sub, so peers routed to different WebSocket
function instances still share one room. Private rooms automatically request
short-lived TURN credentials from same-origin `/api/ice`; the deployment keeps
the long-lived provider token server-side. `VITE_ICE_CONFIG_URL` only overrides
that endpoint for a separate credential service. LAN remains direct.

Credential acquisition classifies provider failures. Bounded retries cover a
transient provider 429/5xx within the original five-second acquisition budget;
permanent `turn_service_unconfigured` and invalid-configuration responses do
not waste time retrying. If acquisition still degrades to STUN, the room UI
labels the result direct-only instead of claiming universal readiness.

The typed room-session owner treats those credentials as an expiring lease.
Late host joins and replacement peer generations refresh near expiry, concurrent
refreshes share one request, and a temporary STUN-only response cannot evict a
still-valid TURN generation. This matters because room membership outlives the
default TURN credential lifetime.

Room signaling membership is durable for 24 hours and refreshed by active
polling. Every mailbox poll has a correlated acknowledgement and a bounded
watchdog; a silently half-open browser WebSocket is replaced and the same room
membership is resumed before a later RTC recovery needs it. An unclean RTC
close reserves the canonical lobby seat, marks the
authority entity disconnected with neutral input, and permits the same player
identity to attach a replacement peer during an active round. The client
attempts ICE restart first, then rotates its signaling runtime epoch and
rebuilds the peer connection. The rendered battle holds its last valid state
for a bounded 60-second recovery window; it does not mount a second battle or
immediately synthesize a loss.

Stable player identity is not used as an RTC generation. Every SDP/ICE relay
is scoped to both page-session IDs, and the signaling store rejects a sender
whose intended receiver session has already been replaced. Page-session
rotation discards negotiation queued by the dead peer connection; ordinary
WebSocket resume preserves and flushes the current generation. This prevents
durable mailbox replay from mixing pre- and post-reload peer connections.
The signaling send boundary checks the browser socket's native ready state as
well as the higher-level client state. A socket that has entered `CLOSING`
before its asynchronous close event arrives cannot receive another native
send: requests fail into the normal reconnect path, while SDP/ICE messages
remain bounded in the current-generation queue. A partial queue flush restores
the unsent suffix before reconnecting, so a handover cannot lose negotiation
messages or emit browser console errors.

STUN-only fallback keeps room creation non-blocking, but cannot traverse every
NAT. A production release must receive HTTP 200 from `/api/ice`, verify that
its `iceServers` contains a `turn:` or `turns:` URL, and gather a relay
candidate from a pristine browser using relay-only ICE policy. HTTP 503, a
STUN-only response, or syntactically valid but unusable credentials are a
degraded deployment even when `/api/signal` is healthy.
`npm run net:prod:check` enforces all requirements without printing credentials;
`--dependency-only` is an endpoint diagnostic, not a release gate.

LAN setup is automatic. Public deployments use their same-origin secure
signaling endpoint for rendezvous, while pages served from localhost or an
RFC1918 address use that host's bundled port-7777 signaling service. LAN does
not request STUN or TURN routes, so match traffic stays on the direct Wi-Fi
WebRTC path; the signaling service only exchanges room and connection metadata.

## Verification

```bash
npm test
npm run test:net:browser
npm run test:net:four
npm run test:net:seven
npm run test:net:seven:live
npm run build
npm run build:private
```

The persistent-room browser soak starts a real signaling server, Vite, and two
Chromium pages. The roster soak runs either one host plus three independent guest
pages in a human 2v2 or one host plus thirteen guests in a full human 7v7. It
applies configurable latency/jitter/snapshot and input loss, then gates every
client's handshake, timeline skew, shared teammate poses, authority convergence,
input acknowledgement lag, transport queues, runtime cost, and clean departure.
That lightweight maximum-roster soak is a network-capacity test; it does not
claim rendered combat quality. `test:net:seven:live` is the player-visible
certification. It runs independent host-rendered and impaired-client-rendered
7v7 matches, puts every human tank into a clear live battlefield engagement,
and requires all fourteen tanks to move and fire through the real authority.
It also requires real hit/damage events on both teams, full event delivery to
every peer, zero prediction hard snaps or dropped history, sub-0.5 m pose steps,
sub-0.3 m backwards steps, sub-0.25 m correction release, sub-0.15 m vertical
correction release, 30+ rendered fps with no freezes, healthy shadow
cascades/WebGL, and clean
first-volley/live screenshots under `.qa-dev/multiplayer-live-7v7/`.

`npm run test:net:entry` exercises the actual game application with a pristine
guest profile. It joins by invite, verifies the lobby-to-loader compositor
handoff, finishes the first battlefield load, reloads during the live round,
requires the same player ID and room code to return to a connected battle, then
closes authority during another covered reload to prove stale async work cannot
remount the match.

Together the soaks prove room policy, identity separation, dual-channel WebRTC
handoff, rematches, authoritative movement and combat, adaptive delivery, and
the maximum fourteen-player room. Rollover pose, stationary recovery timing,
and the bounded auto-right transition run in the same fixed-step simulation for
solo, browser-hosted private rooms, and dedicated authority; `tank_autoflip` is
an authority event, never a client-side pose correction. Node tests separately
cover four-client dedicated WebSockets, hidden-coordinate filtering, combat
authority, consumables, ram/HE damage, bots, reconnect, matchmaking, Elo
persistence, abuse bounds, and all-map collision.

Useful service commands:

```bash
npm run server:signal  # default ws://127.0.0.1:7777/signal
npm run server:match   # default http://127.0.0.1:8790 + ws://.../match
```
